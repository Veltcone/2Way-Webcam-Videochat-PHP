## Installation Instructions for PHP 2Way Webcam Videochat
 * Before installing, make sure your hosting environment meets all [requirements](https://videowhisper.com/?p=Requirements) (including a supported RTMP server). 

 1. If you're not hosting RTMP with VideoWhisper (see requirements and turnkey hosting options) go to [RTMP Application Setup](https://videowhisper.com/?p=RTMP+Applications) for installation details
 2. Deploy files to your web installation location. (Example: yoursite.domain/2Way-Webcam-Videochat-PHP/)
 3. Fill your RTMP path into settings.php
 4. If you don't have SuPHP, enable write permissions (0777) for folders: snapshots, uploads
If you have Wowza hosting with VideoWhisper.com, staff can assist with setting this up (plans come with a rtmp address preconfigured for such usage).


This is a simple setup for easy deployment and integration with other PHP scripts.
